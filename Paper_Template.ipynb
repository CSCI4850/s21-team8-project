    "Our motivation for this project was to create a useful application of a trained neural network to respond to simple questions and give guidance to customers in a real world situation. Our chatbot can answer questions that relate to a business it is trained on. It could be implemented in an online store website, and could also be implemented in some sort of text message system.  Our key aim when creating this project was to come up with a useful tool that could be customized for lots of different situations. If our bot does not know the answer to a question, it can google it.  \\cite{b1}."

    "For our chatbot, we used tensorflow, JSON, numpy, keras, IPython.display, and matplotlib.pyplot in order to build a functioning chatbot. Tensorflow and keras were used to build the bot, JSON was used to read our training data, numpy was used to create arrays from our data, IPython.display was used to display results, and matplotlib.pyplot was used to plot our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we used a .JSON file to store our training data. We filled this file with phrases that are likely to be asked by the user, along with various responses to these phrases. After importing this file, we extracted the data into words and labels (words[] and labels[]) as well as patterns and their associated tags (docs_x and docs_y). We then stemmed the words in order to slim down and simplify the data for our bot. We used LancasterStemmer from nltk.stem.lancaster in order to perform the stemming.\n",
    "\n",
    "After stemming, we looped through our words (both input and output) and represented each sentence with numbers (creating a bag of one-hot-encoded words). Finally, we turned these lists into numpy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we built a multilayer network with ReLU hidden layers. We created an output layer of size 6 with a softmax activation function. We compiled this model with the Adam optimizer and all normal Adam optimizer hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "After compiling, we trained our model with a batch size of 1 and went through 100 epochs. The program will then run the chat function, which will continue to run until the user types ‘quit.’ \n",
